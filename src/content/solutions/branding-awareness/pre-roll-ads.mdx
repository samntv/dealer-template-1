    description: "Pre-roll video ads are short, non-skippable video advertisements that play before online video content on platforms like YouTube, news sites, and streaming services. Typically 15 to 30 seconds long, pre-roll ads capture viewer attention at the most critical moment—right before they watch their chosen content. Unlike skippable ads, pre-roll ensures 100% of your target audience sees your complete message, making it one of the most effective formats for building brand awareness and driving engagement."

    description: "With over 80% of internet traffic now video content, pre-roll advertising puts your brand in front of highly engaged audiences at the perfect moment. Unlike banner ads or social media posts that can be scrolled past, pre-roll video ads demand attention with sight, sound, and motion. Advanced targeting options allow you to reach specific demographics, interests, and behaviors across YouTube, news sites, and premium video networks. Combine pre-roll with complementary strategies like social media advertising, connected TV campaigns, or display advertising to create a comprehensive video marketing strategy that maximizes brand awareness and drives measurable results."

    title: "Pre-Roll Video Advertising FAQs"
    description: "Common questions about pre-roll video ads on YouTube and streaming platforms."
    order: 7
    faqs:
      - question: "What platforms do pre-roll video ads run on?"
        answer: "Pre-roll video ads run on YouTube, premium news websites, entertainment sites, streaming video platforms, and video content networks. We help you select the best platform mix based on where your target audience watches video content to maximize reach and engagement."
      - question: "How long should pre-roll video ads be?"
        answer: "Pre-roll video ads are typically 15 or 30 seconds long. Fifteen-second ads work well for simple, direct messages and brand awareness, while 30-second ads allow for more storytelling and detailed product information. We'll recommend the optimal length based on your campaign goals and message complexity."
      - question: "How much does pre-roll video advertising cost?"
        answer: "Pre-roll video advertising costs vary based on targeting, platforms, ad length, and campaign duration. Most campaigns start around $1,500-$3,000 per month with CPV (cost per view) rates typically ranging from $0.10-$0.30. We work with budgets of all sizes and provide transparent pricing with detailed ROI projections."
      - question: "Are pre-roll ads skippable?"
        answer: "Pre-roll ads can be either skippable or non-skippable depending on the platform and ad format. Non-skippable pre-roll ads (15-30 seconds) ensure 100% of viewers see your complete message. Skippable ads (after 5 seconds) typically cost less but may have lower completion rates. We'll recommend the best format for your goals and budget."
      - question: "How effective is pre-roll video advertising?"
        answer: "Pre-roll video advertising is highly effective with average completion rates of 70-90% for non-skippable ads. Video ads drive 27% higher brand recall and 23% higher purchase intent compared to display ads. Pre-roll works especially well for brand awareness, product launches, event promotion, and driving website traffic."
      - question: "Do you provide video production services?"
        answer: "Yes! We offer complete video production services including scriptwriting, professional voiceover talent, video editing, motion graphics, and sound design. If you have existing video content, we can adapt it for pre-roll placement. Production typically takes 10-14 business days from concept to final delivery."
      - question: "Can I target specific audiences with pre-roll ads?"
        answer: "Absolutely! Pre-roll video advertising offers advanced targeting including demographics (age, gender, income), geographic location, interests, viewing behavior, device type, and even specific YouTube channels or video content categories. This precision targeting ensures your video ads reach the most relevant viewers."
      - question: "How do I measure pre-roll ad performance?"
        answer: "We provide detailed analytics including total video views, view completion rate, click-through rate, website visits, time on site, conversions, and cost per acquisition. For campaigns with conversion tracking, we measure leads, sales, and ROI directly attributed to your pre-roll video advertising."
      - question: "Can I combine pre-roll with other advertising strategies?"
        answer: "Yes! Pre-roll video advertising works exceptionally well as part of a multi-channel strategy. Combine it with connected TV advertising, social media video ads, display advertising, or YouTube advertising to create a comprehensive video marketing approach that maximizes brand awareness and drives results across multiple touchpoints."
