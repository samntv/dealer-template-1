    description: "Pre-roll video ads are short, non-skippable video advertisements that play before online video content on platforms like YouTube, news sites, and streaming services. Typically 15 to 30 seconds long, pre-roll ads capture viewer attention at the most critical moment—right before they watch their chosen content. Unlike skippable ads, pre-roll ensures 100% of your target audience sees your complete message, making it one of the most effective formats for building brand awareness and driving engagement."

    description: "With over 80% of internet traffic now video content, pre-roll advertising puts your brand in front of highly engaged audiences at the perfect moment. Unlike banner ads or social media posts that can be scrolled past, pre-roll video ads demand attention with sight, sound, and motion. Advanced targeting options allow you to reach specific demographics, interests, and behaviors across YouTube, news sites, and premium video networks. Combine pre-roll with complementary strategies like social media advertising, connected TV campaigns, or display advertising to create a comprehensive video marketing strategy that maximizes brand awareness and drives measurable results."
