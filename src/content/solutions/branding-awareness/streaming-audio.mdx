    title: "Streaming Audio Advertising FAQs"
    description: "Common questions about advertising on streaming music and podcast platforms."
    order: 7
    faqs:
      - question: "What platforms do streaming audio ads run on?"
        answer: "Your streaming audio ads can run on major music streaming services and premium podcast networks. We help you select the best platform mix based on your target audience demographics, listening habits, and campaign objectives to maximize reach and ROI."
      - question: "How much does streaming audio advertising cost?"
        answer: "Streaming audio advertising costs vary based on targeting parameters, platform selection, ad length, and campaign duration. Most campaigns start around $1,000-$2,500 per month with CPM (cost per thousand impressions) rates typically ranging from $15-$35. We work with budgets of all sizes and provide transparent pricing with no hidden fees."
      - question: "What's included in creative production?"
        answer: "We handle complete audio ad production including strategy consultation, scriptwriting, professional voice talent selection and recording, sound design, music licensing, and final mixing. You'll review and approve everything before launch. Production typically takes 7-10 business days from concept to final delivery."
      - question: "How effective is streaming audio advertising?"
        answer: "Streaming audio ads are highly effective with 100% completion rates (non-skippable), 24% higher brand recall than display ads, and strong conversion rates when properly targeted. Audio advertising works especially well for local businesses, e-commerce, automotive, healthcare, and service-based industries looking to build brand awareness and drive action."
      - question: "How is streaming audio different from traditional radio?"
        answer: "Unlike traditional radio, streaming audio advertising offers precise demographic and behavioral targeting, real-time performance tracking, non-skippable ad delivery, and the ability to reach listeners across multiple devices (mobile, desktop, smart speakers). You can target specific audiences by age, location, interests, and listening habits—something impossible with traditional radio's broad reach."
      - question: "Can I target specific geographic areas?"
        answer: "Yes! Streaming audio advertising allows precise geographic targeting from national campaigns down to specific ZIP codes, cities, or radius targeting around your business locations. This makes it perfect for local businesses, multi-location brands, and regional campaigns looking to reach listeners in specific markets."
      - question: "How do I measure streaming audio ad performance?"
        answer: "We provide detailed analytics including total impressions delivered, completion rates, listener demographics, geographic performance, time-of-day insights, and website traffic driven by your ads. For campaigns with conversion tracking, we can measure leads, sales, and ROI directly attributed to your streaming audio advertising."
