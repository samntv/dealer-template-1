    order: 7
    faqs:
      - question: "Why should I claim my listing?"
        answer: "By claiming your profile, you gain control over the information displayed by Google. Without claiming your listing, Google may inaccurately present details about your business, potentially leading to misinformation and missed sales opportunities."
      - question: "What if I do not have access to the previous owner's account for the business?"
        answer: "Regaining access can take some extra steps such as providing additional documentation to prove your ownership. We have experience working with Google to get new owners properly verified, ensuring you have full control of your digital presence."
      - question: "How important is it to have a Google Business Profile?"
        answer: "Having a claimed Google Business Profile is essential to business success. An optimized profile impacts visibility in Google Search and Maps, builds trust and credibility with potential customers, and drives more foot traffic to your <a href='https://ntxidb.com/website-design/' style='font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: inherit;'>website</a>."
